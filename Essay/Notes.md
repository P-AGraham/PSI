# $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry
Saying a quantum system has a *discrete* $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry is the same as saying that there exists a symmetry operator $S$ which squares to identity and commutes with the hamiltonian $H$ while not being a generator of a continuous symmetry (which could include $\mathbb{Z}_2$ as a subgroup)

# Spontaneous symmetry breaking
SSB is usually associated to a degeneracy in the ground state of a system having a continuous symmetry. At low temperature, the system can localize the expectation value for its dynamical symmetry breaking field in the field value sub-manifold minimizing the potential. The Mermin-Wagner theorem theorem describes if this state can stay localised in this sub-manifold or if the goldstone bosons (excitations of the field specifically in the sub-manifold where the potential is flat leaving only the massless kinetic term in the lagrangian) fluctuate too much leading to an impossibility of long range ordering (order means symmetry breaking) at a specific point in the sub-manifold. Quantum tunneling trough the potential barrier defining the ground state sub-manifold is possible, but it is a supressed effect with growing system size: the average value for the field at a given point $x$ is the same everywhere for a transationally symmetric theory. The bigger the volume is the longer it will take for a field prepared in a a localized region of the sub-manifold to tunnel to the other side in a substancial amount of points to make a difference in the expectation value.

# Fuzzy sphere relation to division algebra
The Fuzzy two sphere (four sphere) has its positions related to the expectation value of pauli matrices (quaternionic pauli matrices) on complex (quaternion) valued spinors. The degree of freedom is the spinor and the position is only known on average as a point on the fuzzy sphere.

## Step 0: Identify the generators of conformal symmetry

Conformal symmetry on the space of scalar functions (which are operators in the path integral formulation, Could also be wave function and the generators then correspond to position space representation of conformal symmetry operators on the hilbert space) is generated by (Lectures_on_Conformal_Field_Theory_D_ge3):
$$
\begin{aligned} 
& P_\mu=i \partial_\mu \rightarrow \text { translations, } \\ & M_{\mu \nu}=i\left(x_\mu \partial_\nu-x_\nu \partial_\mu\right) \rightarrow \text { rotations, } \\ & D=i x^\mu \partial_\mu \rightarrow \text { dilatations, } \\ & K_\mu=i\left(2 x_\mu\left(x^\nu \partial_\nu\right)-x^2 \partial_\mu\right) \rightarrow \text { SCTs } .
\end{aligned}
$$
If the operators have a spinor degree of freedom, the representation of the rotation group acting on them also includes a internal space generators (like the pauli matrices)

## Step 1: Identify lorentz algebra from confromal generators
Notice that the conformal algebra can be reorganized as $SO(n+1, 1)$. We start from the abstract commutation relations:

$$\begin{aligned}& {\left[M_{\mu \nu}, M_{\rho \sigma}\right]=-i\left(\delta_{\mu \rho} M_{\nu \sigma} \pm \text { permutations }\right)} \\ & {\left[M_{\mu \nu}, P_\rho\right]=i\left(\delta_{\nu \rho} P_\mu-\delta_{\mu \rho} P_\nu\right)}\\ & {\left[D, P_\mu\right]=-i P_\mu} \\ & {\left[D, K_\mu\right]=i K_\mu} \\ & {\left[P_\mu, K_\nu\right]=2 i\left(\delta_{\mu \nu} D-M_{\mu \nu}\right)}\end{aligned}$$

which can be reorganised as 

$$\begin{aligned} & J_{\mu \nu}=M_{\mu \nu}, \\ & J_{\mu+}=P_\mu, \\ & J_{\mu-}=K_\mu \\ & J_{+-}=D,\end{aligned}$$

or in a matrix 

$$
J_{AB} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & D & K_{\mu}\\
-D & 0 & P_{\mu}\\
-K_{\mu} & -P_{\mu} & M_{\mu \nu}
\end{pmatrix}
$$
which encodes $SO(D+1, 1)$ in the light cone coordinates (constructed form cartesian coordinates $X^1 \cdots X^{D+2}$ by replacing the last two by light cone coordinates $X^{-} = X^{D+2}-X^{D+1}$ and $X^{+} = X^{D+2}+X^{D+1}$). To get a $SO(d+1, 1)$ familiar comutation structure, we define $A_a = (D/2, (K_\mu + P_\mu)/2)$ and $B_a = (-D/2, (K_\mu - P_\mu)/2)$ to have 
$$
\begin{align*}
[A_a, A_b] &= 
[D/2, D/2] \quad [D, K_\mu + P_\mu]/2 \quad [K_\nu + P_\nu, K_\mu + P_\mu]/4 \\
&= 0 \quad i(-P_\mu + K_\mu)/2 \quad    [P_\nu, K_\mu]/4 +[K_\nu, P_\mu]/4 \\
&= 0 \quad i(-P_\mu + K_\mu)/2 \quad    i\left(\delta_{\nu \mu} D+M_{\mu \nu}\right)/2 - i\left(\delta_{\mu \nu} D-M_{\mu \nu}\right)/2\\
&= 0 \quad iB_b \text{ (first row of new rotations)} \quad iM_{\mu \nu} \text{ (block of usual rotation)}
\end{align*}
$$
(https://arxiv.org/pdf/1204.3894.pdf, Conformal_block_projective_null_cone p.7-8)

## Step 2: Restrict the dimension from $(D+2)$ to $D$
We start by restricting to the null cone submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^{D+2}$ where $X \cdot X = 0$ (of dimension $D+1$). Then we projectivize this submanifold by identifying $X \sim \lambda X$. We get the space of directions on the null cone. We are interested in the action of the algebra on this space inherited from its action on $\mathbb{R}^{D+2}$. To work in on the projective cone, we have to pick a set of representative (a section of the cone traversed by each light ray only once). We pick $X_+ = 1$ and the $X \cdot X = 0$ condition forces 
$$-X_- \times X_+ - x^2 =0 \iff X_- = x^2\quad (\text{$x$ contains the $D$ dimensionnal cartesian coordinates})$$ 
We get $X = (1, x^2, x_\mu)$


## Step 3: Apply $SO(D+1, 1)$ transformation to the projective null cone
A lorentz transformation $h$ will, in general change $X_+$ and move out of our section of representatives. We therefore represent the action of conformal transformations on $\mathbb{R}$ by $h X/(hX)_+$ to bring back the output to the slice $X_+ = 1$. This rescaling of $hX$ keeps it on the cone because a rescales null vector is still null. We also have that we are still on the cone after the action of $h$ because the $0$ norm of $X$ is preserved by $h \in SO(D+1, 1)$.

Note: $X \cdot Y = (-X_+ Y_--X_- Y_+)/2 + x_{\mu} y^{\mu} = (-y^2-x^2)/2 + x_{\mu} y^{\mu} = -(x-y)^2/2$ becaude the metric in light cone coordinates is given by

$$
-d(X^{D+2})^2 + d(X^{D+1})^2 = -d(X_+ + X_-)^2/4 + d(X_+ - X_-)^2/4 = -dX_+ dX_-/2 - dX_- dX_+/2
$$


## Papers

### Icosahedron 

The symmetry group of the icosahedron is $I_h \cong A_5 \times \mathbb{Z}_2^{O(3)}$ $A_5$ is a subset of $SO(3)$ (represents rotations but is also the alternating group of even permutations on $5$ letters)

The conjecture done in this paper is that finite size effects can be seen as a perturbation terms from CFT operators (only primaries commute with the CFT hamiltonian). They take the Ising on a Icosahedron to introduce correcting terms that maximize the CFT agreement. 

CFT agreement is measured as a sum on rescales energies subtracted from scaling dimension over all levels that are expected to correspond to the CFT. 

Knowing that the monopole harmonics are rotation invariant, what is the set of hamiltonian terms that preserve the rotation symmetry. (Precisely all the two body interaction (4-fermion operator) that are rotationnaly invariant are the pseudo potentials)

### Conformal_fields_OPE_Critical_quantum_spin_chains

Why do we say that the **Low** energy physics of a critical point is given by a CFT if the hamiltonian has conformal invariance at all scales at this point? The RG flow takes us Away from the CFT to the Ferromagnetic and Paramagnetic phases, so we have to start exactly at the CFT to stay there under a flow to the IR (It is already an IR fixed point so why do we need to specify a scale?)

In 2D a CFT is fully specified by the central charge, conformal dimensions (what are these? They come in conjugate pairs and the double of their real part for a given pair is the scaling dimension of the associated primary operator), OPE coefficients for primary operators. 

Problem: Finite size converge slowly: exponential growth of hilbert space dimension. Find the date of emergent CFT provided the microscopic model

method 1: Find the critical point+evaluate 2 and 3 point operators-> all CFT Data
method 2: Use state operator correspondance (Is state operator correspondance only valid on a spherical quantization). Suppose the CFT Data is close to the low energy spectrum of the CFT data

Problem of method 2: Does not provide the OPE coefficients
Solution: Express the local lattice operators in terms of CFT operators. Then, use the OPE coefficients for the lattice operators to approximate the ope coefficient of the CFT operators involved in the decomposition.

The structure constants (OPE coefficients) show up in the three point functions of primary operators. 

Computed the leading order term in the expansion of all one-site and all two-site operators

Start by fourier decomposing the operator (the decomposition modes create momentum eigenstates when acted on the vaccuum) on the circle at $\tau = 0$. Take the operator to be a primary operator to start with. Then the action of a fourier mode on the vacuum is decomposable in a sum over the nth derivative descendants (derivatives come in conjugate variables pairs (to preserve hermiticity?))

Take the initial decomposed operator to be a derivative descendant. The expansion for this descendant fourier modes can be found by taking the derivatives of the primary expansion. The OPE coefficients can be extracted from $\bra{\text{primary}}\text{primary}(0)\ket{\text{primary}}$ ($0$ is the reference point of the three point function)

Lattice operators as CFT scaling operators : truncate the CFT expansion of a local operator. The accuracy is bounded by the size of the system (number of spins) and lowest scaling dimension of truncated operators $O(1/N^{\Delta_c})$

We then fourier expand the local operators and eveluate the matrix element $\bra{\text{low energy state ~ CFT state}}\text{Decomposed operator mode}\ket{\text{ground state}}$. Using the previous decomposition in terms of **derivative descendants** (not modes) of a **derivative descendant mode operator**, we can evaluate  $\bra{\text{low energy state ~ CFT state}}\text{mode decomposition of low energy state ~ CFT state}\ket{\text{ground state}}$

With the truncated series, the modes of the expanded operators gain a CFT operator expansion and 
the matrix element $\bra{\text{low energy state ~ CFT state}}\text{mode decomposition of operator}\ket{\text{ground state}}$ is expanded in terms of $\bra{\text{low energy state ~ CFT state}}\text{mode decomposition of low energy state ~ CFT state}\ket{\text{ground state}}$ with **the same coefficients used in the initial truncated expansion**

THe coefficients are found by solving an optimization problem (minimizing the sum of the square of $\left\langle\psi_\beta\left|\mathcal{O}^s\right| 0\right\rangle-\left\langle\psi_\beta^{C F T}\left|\tilde{\mathcal{O}}^{C F T, s}\right| 0^{C F T}\right\rangle$ (the left term is evaluated directly from the **numerical solution** and the right term is evaluated **analytically**) summed on all modes and $\beta$)

This maximizes the agreement between CFT data and the expansion without knowledge of the OPE coefficients (the only CFT data used concerns the low lying states and only "two point functions")


### OPE_coeff_3D_Ising_Fuzzy_sphere

The OPE coefficients govern the **Fusion** of two primary fields (The fusion rules are obtained by imporsing that two OPE expansion converging in a common region shoul match in that region. For $n$-point functions this means that each pairing of operators mapped to a single operator iteratively should give the same result)
Note: In the landscape of CFT 2D is the same as 1+1D (infinite dimensionnal algebra?)

Common scenario of scymmetry enhancement happens when scale invariance is enhanced by conformal invariance.

external note: THere is no CFT at the fixed point from the start. We initially have a microscopic Hamiltonian and we flow at the critical point (staying there in phase parameter space, but moving in the space of hamiltonians to a continuum Hamiltonian expressed with fields)

Complete conformal data is enough to calculate universal properties of phase transitions and their stability close to a fixed point : Example thermal and charge conductivity

Bootstrap struggles to make contact with some universalities because it is too general : Alternative study microscopic models that realize the universality of interest ---> Before this approach was limited to two or three OPE coefficients (unsing two body correlators or off-critical two-point correlators)

**Is this related to Conformal_fields_OPE_Critical_quantum_spin_chains?**: Yes, Cardy's scheme tries to use microscopic data to get conformal data trough the state-operator correspondance (on the radial quantized cylinder with axis in the time direction). 

The reason $1+1D$ CFT data has been studied more than other CFT data with Cardy's scheme is that there is no lattice regularization of the sphere realizing state operator correspondance. 

External note: The number of electrons at *half filling* on the fuzzy sphere is equal to the degeneracy of the lowest landau level. 

The radius of the sphere is $~\sqrt{s}$ (goes to infinity when we make the commutation relation vanish: its like if $R/s$ ($\left[\tilde{x}_\mu, \tilde{x}_\nu\right]=i \frac{R}{s} \epsilon_{\mu \nu \rho} \tilde{x}_\rho$) was an effctive $\hbar$ for the spin representation of the fuzzy sphere position operators. This is consistent with the commutative ("classical") operator algebra at large $s$). 

The fuzzy sphere microscopic model shares symmetry/symmetry breaking with the $(2+1)D$ dimensionnal Ising model (and can be used to extract CFT data). 

External note: state operator correspondance happens in the IR: It is a field theory feature, but the fuzzy sphere method makes this correspondance establish fast by realizing rotationnal invariance at all system size. Question: Is it possible to define a (1+1D) fuzzificaltion of the lattice realizing exact rotation invariance on the circle.  

Any gapless operator can be expressed on a time slice with CFT operators (primaries and descendants). The operators involved will have the same parity (perticle-hole symmetry that becomes Parity in the CFT ---> this not a CFT symmetry usually so can we say we have en enriched CFT? The added $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry should not add anything to the CFT+P symmetry because CFT is the largest non trivial symmetry group?) 

External note: CFTs can be enriched with global symmetries like $\mathbb{Z}_2$ (asked ChatGPT need a better reference)

The spin weighted spherical harmonics involved in the fuzzy sphere model have $s = l$ $Y_{s, m}^{(s)}$. Spin $s$ wighted spherical harmonics are still seigenfunctions of the Laplace Beltrami operator on the sphere (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-weighted_spherical_harmonics)

At half filling a spin excitation is a particle hole excitation because a hole-hole or particle-particle excitation has total spin contribution $0$ (Pauli exclusion principle)

Use the Spherical harmonics instead of monopole harmonics for the expansion of spin operators because these operators do not see the monopole (they are defined on the full sphere) we are using $2s+1$ different monopole harmonics to expand the landau orbital creation operator. It appears that all the spherical harmonics with $l \in \{0, 2s\}$ are need to form a generatin set of the monopole harmonics used (this is an overcomplete basis). 

Start with the $\tau = 0$ (why do we work in euclidean time) expansion 

$$\hat{\mathcal{O}}(\tau=0, \boldsymbol{\Omega})=\sum_\alpha c_\alpha \hat{\phi}_\alpha(\tau=0, \boldsymbol{\Omega}).$$

Then use the fact $\bra{\phi_\alpha} \phi_\beta \ket{0}$ is $\bra{\phi_\alpha}\ket{\phi_\beta}$ which can be expressed as 

$$\begin{aligned} \bra{0}\phi(z)|\psi\rangle =\bra{0}\phi(z) \psi(0)|0\rangle  =\sum_p C_{\phi \psi p} \bra{0}O_p(0)|0\rangle\end{aligned}$$

## Scaling transformation:

The dilation operator $D$ is closely related to the scaling dimension of CFT operators because of the ladder structure in the commutation relations:
$$
\left[D, P_\mu\right]=+i P_\mu, \quad\left[D, K_\mu\right]=-i K_\mu.
$$
**Pay attention to ladder structures in the future**
We recall that $P_{\mu} = i \partial_\mu$ (that is the origin of the notation for descendant operators which are constructed from derivatives and their contractions) and $K_\mu=i\left(2 x_\mu\left(x^\nu \partial_\nu\right)-x^2 \partial_\mu\right)$ (Lowers the scaling dimension it is the conjugation of a an inversion by two translations). The transformation generated on $\mathbb{R}^{d+1, 1}$ by $K_\mu$ are boosts: if two boosts are composed than a rotation $P_{\mu}$ is involved. Boosting along the $X^{D+1}$ direction is associated to $D$. 

$P_\mu$ acts as a "derivative": it increases the scaling dimension by strenghtening the effect of space volume on the operator

## Conformal transformations

Senech Chapter 4

1. Define conformal transformation of the metric (structure preserving map for which the structure is given by angles and not distance)
2. Write and solve the killing equation to get the infinitesimal transformation of spacetime that make the metric undergo conformal transformation. These transformations do not preserve the initial spacetime manifold: they rescale distance locally and $\text{d}s^2$ is not preserved. The topological manifold can stay the same but the Riemannian manifold structure must change. Any conformal transformation is continuous and preserves the topological manifold: For flat space, we can picture it as position dependant rescaling mapping $\mathbf{R}^{n}$ to $\mathbf{R}^n$. Comparing the distance between closeby points before rescaling and after, we find the local scale factor changing the metric locally. We can compose this **Weyl** transformation with a diffeomorphism (change of basis induced from change of coordinates as opposed to change of metric) so that the new basis hides the transformation of the metric leavin the components unchanged (This diffeomorphism in combination with a Weyl transformation forms the usual notion of a *Conformal transformation*). The fundamental principle we start with is that conformal transformations rescale the metric locally .... but, from there, we need to find all transformations of spacetime that fit this constraint.     
3. Consider a field $\phi(x)$ and suppose it has scaling dimension $1$ so that the effect of the conformal transfromation is changing the base point of the field values. We write $\phi'(x')=\phi(x)$ (the actual value in unaffected) implying $\phi'(x') = \phi(g^{-1}x')$ where we precompose with the inverse of the conformal transformation to pull back the field. We can then extract the infinitesimal effect of a flow along each conformal killing vector field. 
4. From the generators of the killing flow on "scaling singlet" functions indentified from the transformations in 3, we can calculate commutators and extract the conformal algebra of which the Poincare+Scaling algebra is a subalgebra. *A subalgebra is a subvector space wich is closed under the lie bracket on that space: the special conformal transformation is isolated from the Poincare algebra in the sens that $[\text{not}K_\mu, \text{not}K_\nu]$ never involves $K_\mu$ making it impossible to generate a SCT by composing poincare transformations* 
5. Knowing the abstract relations between generators provided by the algebra, find the representations of the generators acting on the fields. To remove the spacetime transformations, place the field at the origin and act on it with a set of transformations that preserve the origin (*This discussion is only valid for local operators because we need to evaluate the field at a given point*). We can do this because an operator acting at $x=0$ can be moved to any point $x$ by conjugating with a translation operator. Evaluating the field at $0$ allows to access the internal effect of conformal transformations. *We think of Scaling fields as special objects meant to be used in a path integral formulation or canonical quantization scheme in the continuum (CFTs describe IR fixed points)*. The only conformal transformation we can't study at the origin is translation (*For the same reason a conformal transformation can be removed from the algebra to yield a valid sub algebra, $P_\mu$ can be removed*). The subalgebra of all origin preserving transformations has the set of commutations $[\Delta, S_{\mu\nu}] = 0$ ($\Delta$ is the operator representing the action of $D$ at the origin). The building blocks of any representations are irreducible representations and we pick the operators to transform with an irreducible spin representation of $S_{\mu\nu}$. This forces (by schur's lemma) the operator $\Delta$ to be a multiple of identity (this multiple has to be imaginary making the representation of the dilation operation on classical fields non-unitary: Any unitary part (hermitian term in $D$), would lead to a trivial representation because $e^{-i\lambda \Delta} O e^{i\lambda \Delta} = O$, however, we have $(e^{\lambda \Delta})^{\dagger} O e^{\lambda \Delta} = O$). At the origin, $D$ is just $\Delta = i \delta \textbf{1}$ and we have $(e^{\delta \lambda})^{\dagger} \phi(0) e^{\delta\lambda} = e^{2\delta\lambda} \phi(0)$ *The scale transformation is non-trivial only for a non-unitary representation consitent with the fact $D$ is used to represent a imaginary time translation generator trough the weyl transformation in radial quantization. Wick rotating the scale parameter seems to lead to a unitary evolution consitent with real time translation. This wick rotation will map the scaling part of the representation to the trivial representation*. In the subalgebra, we also have the commutation $0 = [\Delta, K_{\mu}] \propto K_\mu$ forcing the $K_\mu$ internal representation to be trivial. **Note: The operators transform with conjugation by unitaries which can be evaluated using the CBH formula for dilations, we have $e^{-iD\lambda} \phi(x) e^{iD\lambda} = \phi(x) + i \lambda [\phi(x), D] -\lambda^2 [[\phi(x), D], D]/2! + \cdots$. We know that $D\phi(x) = (-ix^\mu \partial_\mu + \Delta)\phi(x)$.**
6. The only transformations that have a non-trivial effect on the internal scale of the operators are possibly $K_\mu$ and $\Delta$ (we saw that $K_\mu$ does not act internally and therefore only $\Delta$ can rescale (it is internally proportionnal to the identity so it will rescale) the fields). We want to calculate the scaling effect of a special conformal transformation (The total scale transformation obtained by a composition of transformation will scale by a factor obtained by multiplying factors for each term) *The commutation relation between $P_{\mu}$ and $K_{\mu}$ contains $D$ meaning that the CBH formula used to translate $K$ from $x=0$ to an arbitrary location will introduce a scaling effect in the SCT. Unlike the dilation operator $D$ which has $\Delta$ as a constant term independant of $x$, the transported SCT at $x$ has a $x$ dependant dilation term $2x_\mu D$* 

External note: An integer spin field is a collection of operators and conjugation by lorentz transformations will transform it into a collection of operators like if these operators were components of a tensor. 

External note: The generators of the conformal transformations form a field of generators (at each point $x$, we have different generators collectively providing integral curves of the killing flow on the manifold)

External note: (Senech page 99, 4.2): At the classial level conformal symmetry follows from Scale+Poincare, but at the quantum level the arguments justifying this extension are broken. Almost copied:"A QFT does not make sens without a regularization giving a length scale (or energy scale) to the theory, this scale breaks conformal invariance whcih can only be restored at fixed points"

## Ward identity

Why do we require conformal invariance of n-point functions? Because of the definition of a symmetry.  

Inspired from QFT 3, tutorial 2:

The global ward identity states that the correlation function of fields $O_1, O_2, \cdots O_n$ at positions $x_1, x_2, \cdots x_n$ is equal to the correlation function of the conformally transformed fields at the same points $\tilde{O}_i(x_i)$. Knowing that scalar fields (trivial internal spin representation) with scalin dimension $\Delta$ transform like
$$
\tilde{O}(\tilde{x}) = \left|\frac{\partial \tilde x}{\partial x}\right|^{\Delta/d} O(x)
$$
(the value of the transfromed operator at the new base point equals its value at the initial base point multiplied by a rescaling)

This allows us to express the value of $\tilde{O}(\tilde{x})$ at $\tilde{x}$ as $\tilde{O}(\tilde{x}) = \left(\left|\frac{\partial \tilde x}{\partial x}\right|(\tilde{g}^{-1} (\tilde{x}))\right)^{\Delta/d} O(\tilde{g}^{-1} (\tilde{x}))$ with the map $g : x \mapsto \tilde{x}$. Then, on the transformed spacetime the same values for $x$ are available and we can evaluate the transformed functions at the same point. For a rescaling transformation we have $\tilde{x} = \lambda x$ implying $\left(\left|\frac{\partial \tilde x}{\partial x}\right|(\tilde{g}^{-1} (\tilde{x}))\right)^{\Delta/d} = (\lambda^{d})^{\Delta/d} = \lambda^\Delta$ and the relation $\tilde{O}(\tilde{x}) = \lambda^{\Delta} O(\tilde{x}/\lambda)$. The ward identity implies $\langle O_1(x_1) O_2(x_2) \rangle = \lambda^{\Delta_1} \lambda^{\Delta_2} \langle O_1(x_1/\lambda) O_2(x_2/\lambda) \rangle$. From the rotationnaly/translationnaly invariant ansatz we obtain the scale invarient ansatz $\langle O_1(x_1) O_2(x_2) \rangle = \frac{G(\Delta_1, \Delta_2)}{x_{12}^{a}}$ where the power $a$ is such that $\frac{G(\Delta_1, \Delta_2)}{x_{12}^{a}} = \lambda^{\Delta_1+\Delta_2}\frac{G(\Delta_1, \Delta_2)}{\lambda^a x_{12}^{a}}$ forcing $a = \Delta_1 + \Delta_2$. To make the form of $G$ precise, we use the SCT invariance (for simplicity we show the result for inversion invariance knowing that the finite SCT argument follows the same logic). The inversion map defined by $\tilde{x}^{\mu} = x^\mu/x^2$ satisfies 

$$
\frac{1}{(\tilde{x}_1-\tilde{x}_2)^2} = \frac{x_1^2 x_2^2}{(x_1-x_2)^2}
$$

Indeed $\tilde{x}_1^{\mu}-\tilde{x}_2^{\mu} = x_1^\mu/x_1^2 - x_2^\mu/x_2^2 = (x_2^2 x_1^\mu - x_1^2 x_2^\mu)/(x_2^2 x_1^2)$ and $(x_2^2 x_1^\mu - x_1^2 x_2^\mu)^2 = x_2^4 x_1^2 +2 x_1^2 x_2^2 x_1^\mu (x_2)_{\mu}  + x_1^4 x_2^2 = x_1^2 x_2^2 (x_1-x_2)^2$. Combining these results, we have 

$$
(\tilde{x}_1^{\mu}-\tilde{x}_2^{\mu})^2 = (x_2^2 x_1^2)(x_1^\mu - x_2^\mu)^2/(x_2^4 x_1^4)
$$

Now the scale factor (Jaccobian) can be derived from the metric (starting with the minkowski metric which can be done without loss of generality for conformally flat spacetimes) transformation by writting 

$$
\Omega(\tilde{x}(x))\eta_{\alpha\beta} = \frac{\partial \tilde x^{\alpha}}{\partial x^{\mu}}(x) \frac{\partial \tilde x^{\beta}}{\partial x^{\nu}}(x) \eta_{\mu\nu}
$$
and taking the determinant on both sides to get $\Omega(\tilde{x}(x))^{d/2} = |\frac{\partial \tilde x^{\alpha}}{\partial x^{\mu}}(x)|$. For inversion, we have 
$$
\frac{\partial \tilde x^{\beta}}{\partial x^{\nu}}(x) = -2 x^\nu x^{\beta}/x^4 + \delta^{\beta}_{\nu}/x^2 
$$

Question: is the Ward identity stating $\langle O_1(x_1) O_2(x_2) \rangle = \langle \tilde{O}_1(\tilde{x}(x_1)) \tilde{O}_2(\tilde{x}(x_2)) \rangle$ meaning the correlation between two points is the same as the correlation between the image of these two points for the same operators?

## OPE expansion

Lectures_on_Conformal_Field_Theory_D_ge3

Goal: Replace product of pairs of nearby local operators by a series of operators evaluated at the midpoint 

Question: often one point function vanish, how does that align with the non vanishing two point function? Identity term in the series? 

The CFT OPE is more powerful than the QFT one. Consider two operators at $x$ and $0$.  These operators generate a state $\phi_1(x)\phi_2(x)\ket{0} = \ket{\psi}$. This state has an expansion in the basis of scalings as 
$$
\ket{\psi} = \sum_n c_n \ket{E_n}, \quad c_n = c_n(x) 
$$
(The coefficients depend on the location of the represented operators). Using the state-operator correspondance, we can associate all the $\ket{E_n}$ states to primaries of descendants. We can write the previous expansion 
$$
\ket{\psi} = \sum_{\text{primary} O} c_O(x, \partial_y) O(y)|_{y = 0}\ket{0},
$$
(we evaluate at $y=0$ at the end to have derivatives yield non-trivial contributions)
This result was not obtained using short distance asymptotics (it is more powerful from the QFT result), its was obtained using state operator correspondance. The $c_O(x, \partial_y)$ can be taylor expanded in $\partial_y$ to fully include a general expansion in descendant operators. 

Question: Can we interpret the asymptotic nature of QFT OPE as a pertrubation theory from the CFT OPE? 

If a QFT lives between two (UV and IR) CFTs, it is possible to do OPE with confromal perturbation theory from both sides and if their domain of convergence overlap the expansions should agree in the overlap. If two CFTs are closeby this should happen (Wilson Fischer fixed point vs gaussian fixed point). *Note: in general it is not possible to write the OPE as a perturbation of the IR CFT so that it is valid for the same lagrangian parameters as the UV CFT OPE perturbative correction because the number of perturbative corrections is infinite from the IR side.*

Question: How can we extract the operators from the state in state operator correspondance ? All the states created by acting primaries and their descendants are orthogonal because of the two-point SCT constraint:
$\langle O_1(x_1) O_2(x_2) \rangle \equiv \bra{0} O_1(x_1) O_2(x_2) \ket{0} = \frac{\delta_{1, 2}}{x_{12}}$ for scalar operators (primaries are usually scalar operators). What about the descendants ? We can show that $(P_\mu\ket{\psi})^\dagger = (\underbrace{\bra{0}I O_\psi I}_{\bra{\psi}}) I P_\mu I = \bra{\psi} K_\mu$ (conjugation conjugates with inversion to match real time quantum mechanics). Then 
$$
\begin{aligned}\left\langle\psi_1\left|K_\mu P_\nu\right| \psi_2 \right\rangle & =\left\langle\psi_1|[K_\mu, P_\nu\right]|\psi_2 \rangle+\left\langle\psi_1\left|P_\nu K_\mu\right| \psi_2\right\rangle \\ & =\left\langle\psi_1\left|2 i\left(D \delta_{\mu \nu}-M_{\mu \nu}\right)\right| \psi_2\right\rangle \\ & =\Delta \delta_{\mu \nu}\langle\psi_1 \mid \psi_2\rangle= 0\end{aligned}
$$
where we used the fact $K_\mu \ket{\text{Primary}} = 0$ note that $\bra{\text{Primary}} K_\mu \neq 0$ (bringin us to use the commutation of $P_\mu$ and $K_\mu$). Since the primaries are scalar assumed to be scalar fields (are they always scalar fields?) they form a trivial representation of $M_{\mu\nu}$ which anihilates the states they create. Any $P_\mu$, $K_\mu$ commutation will bring a $D$ term and a $M_{\mu\nu}$ term. If the number of $K$ is greater than the number of $P$ (descendants of different wieghts), then after commuting all pairs some $K$ remain but no $P$ remains in the only possible non vanishing terms. Note that after the first pair, we need to deal with the commutator of $K$ with $D$ and $M_{\mu\nu}$. All these commutators involve only $K$ and the "$K$" passes trough each commutation with the commutator $[P, K]$ : only commutations of $K$ with $P$ can remove $K$ from the chain and prevent its anihilation. Therfore, we can move the unpaired $K$ all the way and get anihilation no matter what the scaling dimension of the unbalanced descendants were. The same reasining applies for a chain with to many $P$. In this case, we have to move $P$ to the left to anihilate with $\bra{\psi}$. Note that in the balanced case with the same primary, there is still a $\delta_{\mu\nu}$ making the expectation value vanish for $\mu \neq \nu$ consistently with the fact each primary/descendant generates an orthogonal state. 

Note: We usually don't have many primaries so a tensor primary would be unexpected. Is it allowed at all? https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/563164/can-a-cft-have-multiple-primary-operators-with-same-scaling-dimension-and-or-spi *In some model there are primaries why non zero spin and different primaries with exaclty the same scaling dimension and spin*

### Radial Quantization/State operator correspondance

#### Reference CFT_Jaume

In radial quantization, we start with $D$ dimensionnal Euclidean space on which we have conformal transformations. Euclidean conformal transformation have the poincare sub-group replaced with $SO(D)$. In this setting "time" is on the exact same footing as space and we are free to quantize our theory with any folitaion of which the elements are labeled by a euclidean time coordinate. Radial quantization foliates Euclidean space with concentric $S^{D-1}$ spheres. Spheres are preserved by rotations and combinations of translation and special conformal transformations (individually these transformations do not preserve the origin and infinity, but composing them with their inverses and exploiting the non commutation of translations and SCTs we can get non trivial transformations preserving spheres). The scale transformation moves a sphere labeled by some radius (playing the role of time after a weyl transformation) to a concentric sphere with different raidus. 

Question: Should we expect all conformal transformaions to preserve the foliation up to relabeling of spheres? 

Potential answer: For the Poincare group, boosts change the foliation by making the equal time surfaces diffenrent in lorentzian geometry. Boosts become rotation in euclidean geometry. IN the radial quantization, boosts become equal euclidean time rotations of the cylinder obtained after the Weyl transformation. Some conformal transformations will break the foliation (after the weyl transformation some sphere will by contractible on the cylinder) 

The foliation comes with an operator generating flow between different spheres ($D$) and a set of operators that commute with it ($M_{\mu \nu}$) : these operators preserve spheres (They include boosts which are indistinguishable from rotations in radial quantization). 

Our quantization is built from states $\ket{\Delta, A}$ with $\Delta$ scaling dimension and $A$ spin label (total spin and projection on an axis). Acting $P_{\mu}$ and $K_{\mu}$ resectively raises and lowers the scaling dimension. 

The weyl transformation maps to a different metric differing from the flat Euclidean metric by a factor of $r^2$

Because of this quantization, we have a state for each spin and scaling dimension. Does this mean that the adjoint representation on the is "identical" to the state representation of the conformal group?

Since our hilbert space has the maximal fully commuting set $D, M_{\mu\nu}$

What do we get when we act $P_{\mu}$ on the vaccum (which has scaling dimension $0$)? We get $P_{\mu}\ket{0}$ which has scaling dimension $1$

Is the stress energy tensor a primary? https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/550418/ope-energy-momentum-tensor-with-itself says no, but then it is a combination of descendants and transforms like a tensor. 

The energy spectrum of the fuzzy sphere is the spectrum of $D$, which we use to extract the scaling dimension of the $\sigma$ and $\epsilon$ which are local CFT operators corresponding to states. 

The idea behind state-operator correspondance is that local CFT primary operators can be fully specified by scaling dimension and spin (they are tensors). Then having specified the primaries, all descendants can be accessed by acting $P_{\mu}$. Furthermore, the primaries are anihilated by $K_{\mu}$

On the operator side, we compute descendants by commuting with $P_\mu$. On the sate side, we directly act $P_{\mu}$ on the state. 

The Vacuum of $D$ is anihilated by both the $P_\mu$ and $K_{\mu}$ operators so it is a primary with no descendants. 

External note: Commutating the Dilation generator $D$ with operator $O$ havin scaling dimension $\Delta$ yields a descendant with scaling dimension $\Delta+1$. This commutator naturally represents the infinitisemal transformation of an operator under $D$. Indeed $U^\dagger O U = (1 - i \epsilon a) O (1 + i \epsilon a) = O + i [O, a]\epsilon$. If $a = D$ we get $O + i \Delta \epsilon$ with $[O, D] = \Delta$

External note: In 2D, the Ising CFT has a finite number of primaries and is exactly solvable, but there are CFTs with an infinite number of primaries requiering more symmetries to be exactly solvable in 2D. There is a notion of a Viasoro primary associated to the generator $L_{m>0}$. 

Question: We define primaries as $K_{\mu}\ket{\phi} = 0$, but is it possible to have states for which only certain $K_{\mu}$ vanish without having all of the vanish? 


#### Lectures_on_Conformal_Field_Theory_D_ge3

For a given foliation, we have Hilbert scpaces on each leaf. Correlation functions are the overlap between states created by acting an operator in the past and states created by acting an operator in the future. To connect operators living on two different leafs, we need to use the evolution operator provided by the Hamiltonian. 

Choosing a foliation that respects the symmetry of the theory (Leafs related by a symmetry transfromation ex: weyl transformed scaling) has the advantage of making the hilbert space on each leaf identical and connected to all others by a symmetry transformation. The Weyl cylinder foliation is preserved by Weyl transformed scaling. *In general, it seems we want to pick a foliation for which there is an orthogonal killing flows with all other killing flows internal to the foliation*. 

Forming a fully commuting set of states in radial quantization requires using a $D$ (hamiltonian, convinient to label states with how they evolve in imaginary time). We have $D\ket{\Delta} = i \Delta \ket{\Delta}$ (consitently with the fact the cylinder manifold is euclidean and not Lorentzian--- *is it lorentzian after a wick rotation? A compact lorentzian space lorentzian manifold has issues with ddefinition of simultaneity and might have no well defined foliation...*). 

There exists another useful way to quantize the $\mathbb{R}^n$ Euclidean space using the operator $K_1 + P_1$ (it does not requiere a Weyl transformation, it looks like radial quantization by with $\infty$ and $0$ moved to points both at finite coordinates called N and S probably in analogy with the rieman sphere poles). 

A tricky point is that, since $D$ is non-hermitian, it is not self-adjoint. *Is $K_\mu + P_\mu$ self-adjoint?*. In the NS map, the dual $\bra{\psi}$ of $\ket{\psi}$ is obtained by applying the reflexion swapping the north and south poles to the ket. This map sends time $\tau$ to time $-\tau$: this has the same effect as conjugating a hermitian field $\phi(x, \tau)$. Indeed, the conjugate of a field can be evaluated in the real time picture and then wick rotated to get the Euclidean time   
$$
\phi(x, t)=e^{-i H t} \phi(x, 0) e^{i H t} \rightarrow \phi\left(x, t_E\right)=e^{-H t_E} \phi(x, 0) e^{H t_E}
$$
implying $\phi\left(x, t_E\right)^{\dagger}=e^{H t_E} \phi(x, 0)^{\dagger} e^{-H t_E}=\phi\left(x,-t_E\right)$. (What is the interpretation of this adjoint). Note that the conjugate field lives at a different time. The operation that swaps the north and south pole in the Cylinder picture is the inversion operation $I$ (note: $K_\mu = I P_\mu I$). Still computing the dual vector to $\ket{\psi}$ in the real time picture and Wick rotating it, we have the natural notion of adjoint $\langle\Psi|=\langle 0|[\phi(x)]^{\dagger},[\phi(x)]^{\dagger}=r^{-2 \Delta_\phi} \phi(I x) \equiv I[\phi(x)]$ (The $r$ factor is obtained by having a representation of the inversion which is a global conformal transformation). With this definition $P_\mu = K_\mu^\dagger$

### More remarks 

Important for OPE coefficients: The action of a field on a primary/descendant might not be a primary or descendant : it might have components in both primary and descendant operators which end up being the OPE coefficients


## Ideas

1. Instead of icosaedron use stars (multiple covers of the 2-sphere) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_polyhedron *This would introduce enough topological defects to destroy the CFT*
2. Write the set of all finite dimensionnal systems on which SO(3) is represented. Use these states to form models with Z2 symmetry breaking (ordering field). 
3. Fuzzyfy the fuzzy sphere: put a magnetic monopole at the center of the fuzzy sphere and implement it in the hamiltonian with the same potnetial vector but where the position operator has a truncated representation (containing only monopole harmonics). This amounts to projecting the Hamiltonian for the original sphere to the monopole harmonic basis. Since it is an eigenbasis of the hamiltonian, this projection does not change the eigenstates and the fuzification is an idempotent map in this context.
4. Example of systems where the fuzzy sphere might be realised in nature. Lead to the question: Can spherical harmonics of a Rydberg atom behave like a fuzzy sphere? The answer seems to be no because the commutaion relation of the harmonics is not related to position in the same way it is for the monopole harmonics (no non-commutative geometry encoded).
5. Use state operator correspondance to write a hamiltonian acting on the operator space of the CFT, it should be the same CFT? What makes a CFT unique: https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/120019/what-uniquely-defines-a-cft (Depends if the CFT is unitary or not). 
6. The dual ising to the Icosahedron is smaller (dodecahedron), but is is as good numerically?
7. Combine magnetic monopole with charge monopole to get a notion cyclotron harmonic. Spherical harmonics should be the dual to monopole harmonics in some sens 
8. The dirac string of the monopole fom a topological deffect that can be gauged away. This defect is such that the manifold where the ising model is effectively studied is not $\mathbb{R}^3$ but $\mathbb{R}^3$ with a string deffect.
9. Use a 4 dimensionnal quaternionic QFT as an "embeding theory" of the fuzzy sphere 
10. Thompson problem algorithm build on a non commutative geometry sequence to the original problem. 
11. Another way to discretize the sphere (golden ratio spiral): https://extremelearning.com.au/how-to-evenly-distribute-points-on-a-sphere-more-effectively-than-the-canonical-fibonacci-lattice/
12. The bloch theorem should generalize for the Icosahedron
13. The Ising CFT is at a special angular point in the crossing equation landscape: there are forbidden CFT data points near it and maybe the CFT data agreeent at finite size can be accelerated by forcing some data into the forbidden region leaing very little possibility in the allowed region
14. The entanglement of the positions of the fermions should be almost minimal and negligible compared to the entanglement of the Ising CFT. This could be acheived by strong localisation effects making the fuzzy sphere model an insulator model. LOcalisation effects are usually due to impurities and here we have a non-commutative impurity

# Code 

1. The $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry operator $S$ has to be diagonalized simultaneously to $H$ and $L^2$ which can be acheived by instead diagonalizing $H + s S + t L^2$ (see https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4387863/simultaneous-diagonalization-and-repeated-eigenvalues) with choices for $s$ and $t$ that lift all degeneracies in the spectrum. We know the spectrum of $L^2$ ($\ge 1$), $S$ ($\in \{-1, 1\}$) and $H$. We can pick $s = 1/2$ and $t = 1$ if we are certain that the hamilonian has no half integer gap between its eigenvalues. We also want to preserve the order of the eigenvalues which is not necessarly done if $S$ shifts by $1/2$. The logic goes as follows: identify smalest non-zero gap in $H$ (noted $a$), $L^2$ ($j(j+1) - (j-1)j = 2j \to 2$) and $Z$ (2). Then the smalest non-zero gap in $H + tL^2$ is $a + 2t$ where we pick $2t < a$. Then the smallest non-zero gap in $H + t L^2 + s S$ is $a + 2t + 2s$ and we want to have $2s < a + 2t$. A consistant choice is $t = a/4$ and $s = (a/2 + t)/2 = (a/2 + t)/2  = 2a/8 + a/8 = 3a/8$. So we diagonalize $H$, find $a$, calculate $H + s S + t L^2$, diagonalize it than remove the eigenvalues of $H$ to find eigenvalues of $s S + t L^2$ which are $V = \pm s + t j(j + 1)$. To extract $j$ try $j^2 + j - (V \mp s)/t = 0$: $j = -1/2 \pm \sqrt{1 + 4 (V \mp s)/t}/2 \to -1/2 + \sqrt{1 + 4 (V \mp s)/t}/2$ (positive root because $j > 0$). Now we need one of the solutions to be an integer. To simplify, we use $V/a$ instead $t \to 1/4$. We then have $1 + 16 (V \mp 3/8)  = 1 \mp 6 + 16 V = (\text{odd})^2$. Supposing the two solutions are valid, we get $(\text{odd})^2 - (\text{odd})^2 = 12 = (2 k + 1)^2 - (2 m + 1)^2 = 4 (k^2 + k - m^2 - m)\implies 3 = (k^2 + k - m^2 - m)$.

# Goal

Finite-size effects in the fuzzy sphere model for the 3D Ising transition: I will look for the two-body spherically symmetric interaction (for fermions on the fuzzy sphere) that leads to the best agreement of the CFT spectrum and the finite-size fuzzy sphere model spectrum. The goal is to understand better why the fuzzy sphere model has such good agreement with the CFT spectrum at a finite size. 

## Step 0

Understand what the TFIM CFT primaries correspond to. 

https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/391444/primary-operators-in-the-ising-cft

$\sigma_n^x \sigma_{n+1}^x-\sigma_n^z \to \epsilon(x)$ (Energy density field primary, $\mathbb{Z}_2$ even, commutes with $P$) This operator is local and depends on a continuous $x$ spacetime position in the IR continuum

$\sigma_n^x$ ($\mathbb{Z}_2 \to \sigma(x)$ odd, anticommutes with $P$) (Local order field, the ordered phase has all spins in the $x$ direction and no symetry breaking ground states, related to the magnetization in the $x$ direction)

The position dependance of these operators allow for derivative descendants.

In what follows, we find the approximate expansion of local finite size operators in these IR operators without knowing their explicit forms (they are fields in a CFT so they are described by their $n$-point functions which are not know if we start with a finitesize spectrum, but with state operator correspondance, we can approximate them).
