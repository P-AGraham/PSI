\begin{quote}
The abstract is an important component of your essay. It is likely the first substantive description of your work read by an external examiner. You should view it as an opportunity to set accurate expectations. The abstract is a summary of the whole thesis. It presents all the major elements of your work in a highly condensed form. An abstract is not merely an introduction in the sense of a preface, preamble, or advance organizer that prepares the reader for the thesis. It must also be capable of substituting for the whole thesis when there is insufficient time and space for the full text.
