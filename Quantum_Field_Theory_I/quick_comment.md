$$
U(L(q)) \ket{p, s} = U(L(q)) U(L(p))\ket{k, s}\\
 = U(R_{\mathbf{p}\times\mathbf{q}}(\theta)) U(L(p'))\ket{k, s}\\
= U(R_{\mathbf{p}\times\mathbf{q}}(\theta)) \ket{p', s}

If $\mathbf{p} \times \mathbf{q} = 0$ the spin does not undergo Thomas precession. If $\mathbf{p} \perp \mathbf{q}$, Thomas precession rotates the spin in a plane containing the initial and final momentum and it could flip it completely (but this does not change the argument made since a single counter example is enough).
