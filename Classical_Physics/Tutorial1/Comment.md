I think the precise formulation of the stationnary action problem requieres a starting curve space (on the configuration manifold) where the stationarity is studied. Provided such a space, the principle is still not well posed because the variation of the action has to yield a differential equation. This only happens on a restricted space of disforming functions $\delta q$. This is important because the las step of the derivation of the seeked differential equation involves taking $\delta q$ to be general enough so it can form a vector basis on the space of functions over the interval $[t_0, t_1]$ (If the Euler-Lagrange system doesn`t hold its right hand side is of this form in general). The euler lagrange equation might only old in the restricted space of functions satisfying constraints on $\delta q$. In the case of the tutorial, $\delta \dot{q}_{01} = 0$ implies that we can only look at projections of the Euler-Lagrange system in a vector space where functions of time have a $0$ first derivative on the boundary. Now we must investigate where the left-hand side of the EL system lives: if it lives in the same space as $\delta q$ our action principle is closer to beeing precise, but if it doesnt, we cant conclude that it vanishes (only that it vanished in a vector subspace). In the case of the tutorial the EL system can be written as $f(q,..., q^{(4)})$. Can it be written as a total time derivative is equivalent to is it integrable. We know that $q$ is four times differentiable.
