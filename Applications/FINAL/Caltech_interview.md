# Questions for me 

1. What is your most creative idea: Dielectric formulation to intuitively understand the wierd aparent electric field in the reference frame of the an accelerated charge. The field seemed to spread trough the entire space time so its source must be the rindler horizon, but how ? The only effect of the horizon on electromagnetism is an effect on the speed of light and I extended this to dielectric permitivity to imitate the effect of space time and realized electromagnetic effects in accelerated reference frames can be understood to as electromagnetic effects in very exotic materials: I then showed that this interpretation was consistent with curvilinear maxwell s equations
2. Who is your role model: Samuel Lemay: I first met him during a science fair event and then contacted him to start learning physics more seriously with help from a physics student. During about 5 years, we discussed everyday and I grew immensly because of his patience passion and support. We went separate ways, but I aspire to play the role he played for a pationnate aspiring physicist in the future. 
3. If you had $10 000 what outreach project: would you conduct (material to present in local high schools introducing people to simulations in physics with a focus on a specific system (say the three body problem)). Use the money as prizes for an outreach contest themed on use of quantum effects in classical games. I feel the, even if these games have complicated structures, trying to make something familiar into something quantum has to help young scientists famaliarize with quantum principles in their purest form!
4. How well do you collaborate with others: In the PSI program I have developped my collaboration skills a lot: I feel I am a good listenner and can blend my ideas in the discussion building on what the rest of the group has brought. I find great satisfaction when a result is constructed with many different ideas form everyone. Truely something that would not have happened in isolation. I also like multidisciplinarity. 
5. What changed since last year: Last year I gain more confidence and independance by going on a 40 day backpack trip to Europe on my own. Then I challenged myself academically to be in the top 100 solvers of a newly released problem of project euler and succeeded (I am proud of this). I then completed the year with the first half of the PSI program which has increased my confidence collaboration skills and my capacity to do research. It made me realise I really wanted to work with technology and a mix of condensed matter, quantum information and computer science!

# Past research 

Talk in detail about the structure of each internship
   
## Jeff 

1. Programming of a graphical user interface in python. 
2. Multiple widgets to implement to improve data analysis consisting of fourier transforms
3. Modified the data storage startegy of the research to HDF5 files

## AM

1. 2D model of NCCO 
2. Produced TPSC simulation data (self energy in imaginary frequencies and spectral weight at 0 frequency) and used Pade aproximants to obtain the real frequency analytic continuation. With this extended data I could verify that conclusions made with imaginary frquency dta alone still held for real frequencies.
3. Extracted the dependance of various parameters in Hubbard U, temperature culminating in a verification that our data was consistent with the Kadowaki-woods ratio observed for multiple materials experimentally. This ratio involves quasiparticle weight and the second derivative of self energy around omega=0
4. Plotting the spactral weight to study the evolution of the shape of the fermi surface with T across the transition from AFM phase to the strange metallic phase. for different dopings this transition happens at different temperature which allowed me to extrapolate where it happens at 0 tempoerature (quantum phase transition)
5. I also observed the transition from the point of view of spectral weight at the intersection points between the antiferomagnetic brillouin zone and the metallic fermi surface observed in the strange metallic phase. When the pseudogap appears there is a valley in the spectral weight at 0 frequency. 
6. All these pseudogap location method combined with a simple implementation of disorder (constant shift in the self energy associated to electron-impurity scattering rate). Showed the effect of disorder on the QCP
7. Vilk criterion : spin correlation length exceeds thermal fluctuation wavelength imply hot spots (violated near the AFM QCP if the disorder is high enough) 


## Ion

1. During my exploration of perturbative techniques to solve partial differential equations, I produced expansion schemes that I can see are connected to feynman diagrams. My equations were essentially a klein gordon equation with sources and I was expanding in different regimes governed by three caracteristic sourcing times taua taur and tauv.
2. System of partial differential equation modeling interactions between the two chirality, two first landau levels for a one dimensionnal weyl semi-metal subjected to strong magnetic field in the direction of the length of the sample and applied uniform electric field in the direction of B. This is for the steady fields applied to the sample: the sample was also subjected to a light pulse matching the transition between the landau levels 
3. Light excites between landau levels, in the excited band electrons can diffuse without relativistic propagation (parabolic band) in the first landau level electrons move at the speed of light and switch chirality because of the combination of electric and magnetic field. there is also elastic scattering between same landau levels. 
4. I analysed the one-dimensionnality of our system (experimental feasability of our sample conditions in general)
5. Animations with fft, special interpolation scheme, and later programmed a more efficient solver based on finite difference method.
6. Gausian pulse creates a charge excitation in the non chiral band and holes in the chiral band which lead to an imbalance of propagation speeds of the charges in the two bands. Then the charge separation produces an electric field which activated charge transfer between chiral bands trough the chiral anomaly trying to restore neutrality. However this transfer leads the balancing charge to overshoot and create a second order internal elevctric field (oscillations arise) 

## Valerio

1. Multi fluid extension of the formailsm to explore the friction between scalar fields in multi scalar tensor gravity
2. Stabilkity analysis of potentially pathological cosmological solutions to scalar tensor gravity with ill defined temperature (used the geometry of the phase space to explain the origin of the pathology)

## Ben 

1. Poincare maps for superconducting cat qubit, KAM theorem
