Hi Dr He,

I am a PSI student interested to contribute to your research.  My background is very diverse including quantum many-body physics, Weyl semimetals, and chaos in quantum computing. Exploration has recently led me to your research about the fuzzy sphere and I would enjoy working on a research project about it.    

Would you be interested in supervising my PSI essay?

I have attached my CV and would be happy to discuss this research possibility in person.
 
Sincerely, 
Pierre-Antoine
