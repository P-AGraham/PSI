# SOP Ideas

Last winter I worked with Professor Alexander Blais's group on a quantum Chaos based single qubit gate. The core of my work was about understanding mixed regular/chaotic dynamics of the classical limit of a superconducting cat qubit subjected to time dependant forcing. The final goal was to establish a relation between rate of tunneling of cat states and the caracteristics of classical chaos. 


Keeping an eye on all the interesting fields I have explored, I am starting to specialize to intersections of condensed matter and quantum information. The decisive element that brought me closer to these disciplines is the connection to technological progress and connections to experiments.

Use the winter project and Essay project to convince I will be doing condensed matter. 

I am currently studying as a Perimeter scholars internationnal (PSI program) master student. For completion of my degree, I will work on an essay about the fuzzy sphere method for 3D CFTs under the supervision of its **inventor?** Yin-Chen He. I will also take part in an intensive winter shcool where to work on **an adaptation of the belief propagation algorithm to Tensor networks (maybe)**.

# EDI ideas 

My classmates from the PSI program are exceptionnal physicists from __ different contries. Learning about their individual experiences and challenges made me more aware of the internationnal state of the physics community. While the program showed how welcoming and collaborative a physics community can be, it also made me want my privileged reality to be shared by every physics institution. In particular, I want to contribute and benefit from an environnement that has good mental health ressources, conferences about EDI issues and a diverse pool of students that can push my understanding of these issues even further.

# Interview 

I like entanglement because it has a very strong explicative power: it makes statistical ensemble for a system in a bath more intuitive. It is a quantum game theory ressource to share correlations but no information.
