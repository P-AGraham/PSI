# SOP Ideas

I am very determinated as a researcher and I really like the thrill of facing the unknown and put every method I learned to work. I like a challenge and I am very perseverent. I want to produce ideas I will be proud of. I always challenge myself to produce better ideas and go further than the lectures ... asking what is next? I like building analogies between concepts I know to strengthen intuition and make every peice of knowledge I have more meaningful. I like thinking about algorithms and feel great satisfaction in the spped up they can provide. I am precise and give importance to consistency of all details. 


Last winter I worked with Professor Alexander Blais's group on a quantum Chaos based single qubit gate. The core of my work was about understanding mixed regular/chaotic dynamics of the classical limit of a superconducting cat qubit subjected to time dependant forcing. The final goal was to establish a relation between rate of tunneling of cat states and the caracteristics of classical chaos.  


Keeping an eye on all the interesting fields I have explored, I am starting to specialize to intersections of condensed matter and quantum information. The decisive element that brought me closer to these disciplines is the connection to technological progress and experiments.

Use the winter project and Essay project to convince I will be doing condensed matter. 

I am currently studying as a Perimeter scholars internationnal (PSI program) master student. For completion of my degree, I will work on an essay about the fuzzy sphere method for 3D CFTs under the supervision of its **inventor?** Yin-Chen He. I will also take part in an intensive winter shcool where to work on **an adaptation of the belief propagation algorithm to Tensor networks (maybe)**.  

MIT is a stepping stone for my career

## Updated paragraphs

### MIT 1

When I was 14 years old, my school held a writting competition about passions and career ambitions. In my entry, I told about my fascination for the fundamental nature of things and my theoretical physics aspirations. This fascination would lead me to participate in outreach contests for four consecutive years. Each projects brought me closer to the foundations of theoretical physics. Concrete applications and corroboration of theory became of utmost importance to me As my undergraduate research exploration unfolded. I had the chance to collaborate with four different research groups in the context of four-month internships. Each research project helped me refine my aspirations and build confidence as a scientist. This confidence and experiences brought me to Perimeter Institute where I am gaining independance as a researcher striving to access the cutting edge of theoretical physics. I am appliying to MIT to continue moving in this direction and honnor the passion that led the 14 year old version of me to win the writting contest.  

Is it possible to work at the frontier of theory and experiment and still explore very abstract mathematical ideas? I think we live in a golden age of physics where technology opens up to the craziest ideas and I plan to take advantage of this in my career. Initially driven by outreach contests, I focused on communicating abstract theoretical ideas ranging from special relativity to classical electromagnetism. Then I had the chance to collaborate with four different research groups in the context of four-month internships. Each research project helped me build confidence as a scientist and define my aspirations. While the first three increased my appreciation of experiments and technological prospects, the last one confirmed my interest in abstract ideas. When I picture the career ahead of me, I see a scientist striving to contribute to technology while trying to make unsuspected connections between different areas of physics.

Interaction between quantum matter and quantum information have sparked countless ideas shaping a second quantum revolution. From high temperature superconducors to superconducting qubits, these ideas reached me as my journey trough academia started and they showed me how modern technology can build on the full elegant machinery of theoretical physics. I aim to become a leader participating in the second quantum revolution with no compromise between practical application and theoretical sophisication. At the age of 14, I won a writting contest about career ambitions by describing a future where I would play an important role in the developpement of physics. This dream stayed with me and at the dawn of specialization, working at MIT would make it a reality. 

My first contact with science took the form of four participations to the Hydro-Québec science fair, followed by a summer job at an astronomical observatory. These opportunities to share my growing passion with the general public made me value scitentifc collaboration deeply. This was reflected trough my three participations and organization of populariszation events at Universite de Sherbrooke as a member of the diversity commitee. I also joined tutoring programs where I helped students individually and in groups troughout undergrad. Lately, I am contributing to the organization of a seminar series for students of my program to share their interests. I plan to carry my desire for excellence in scientific communicaton by contributing to the impressive outreach programs at MIT notably material sciences related.   

While outreach projects fostered my interest in the foundations of modern physics, internships made me explore and refine my aspirations. Eager to go beyond courses and start contributing to science directly, I took an internship during the first summer of undergraduate. I joined Prof. Jeffrey Quilliam's group to conceive an interface treating nuclear magnetic resonance data generated by experiments on frustrated Kagome crystals at high pressure. Troughout the summer, I developped a rigorous work ethic as I implemented Fourier analysis of spin echos, curve fitting tools and efficient data storing. Along the way, interactions with experimentalists tainted my theorist view of physics with an appreciation of the work behind data.

With the reality of experimentalists in mind, My theoretical physics journey journey started in Prof. André-Marie Tremblay's group. I was tasked to produce and analyse data from two-particle self-consistent approach simulations of electron-doped cuprates. At the beginning of the project, I demonstrated efficient self-learning by rapidly gaining working understanding of Matsubara frequencies and their role in the evaluation of many-body functions. Meticulousely exploring simulation data, I devised a procedure to locate the quantum critical point of the electron-dopped phase diagram using an approximate temperature for antiferromagnetic pseudogap appearence. My analysis allowed me to qualify the effect of a simple implementation of disorder on the quantum critical point and helped orient further research that would lead to a publication in Physical Review B. Looking back, I see this internship as the origin of my current ambitions in the material sciences. It is the idea that my work could lead to new technologies that made it so engaging for me. 

The thrill of material sciences became even more vivid with my next internship project. This time, I was working with Prof. Ion Garate on an adaptation of the Van Roosbroeck system of partial differential equations providing a semi-classical description of Weyl semimetals. The goal of the project was to solve the equations to gain insight into the semi-classical role of the chiral anomaly. Having more independance, I produced animations of the numerical evolution of charge densities through time and found a way to decouple the equations using Ampère's law. In the end, we identified the presence of photoinduced plasma oscillations leading to a publication in Physical Review B. This internship introduced me to the intricacies of non-equillibrium phenomenas and the challenging task of bringing a theoretical model closer to experiment. 

As my interest for condensed matter became more established, I felt the need to take a detour to explore other areas of physics. To satisfy my curiosity towards gravitationnal physics, I worked with Prof. Valerio Faraoni's group on a map scalar-tensor gravity to a dissipative fluid with an associated temperature. In the first half of the internship, I used perturbation theory to explain why a family of cosmological solutions have ill-defined temperatures. The analysis led to a Physical Review D paper. In the second half, I proposed an extension of the formalism to multi-scalar tensor gravity, by introducing the idea of an effective multi-fluid described in publication in The European Physical Journal Plus. Group discussion at the root of these results made me a more confident scientist.

As a second contact with non-equillibrium physics, I worked with a student from Prof. Alexander's group on the mixed regular/chaotic dynamics of a driven superconducting cat qubit and its classical limit. Writting multiple algorithms to analyse chaos, non-linear resonnances and their quantum signatures made me realize how stimulated I was by algorthms 


# EDI ideas 

My classmates from the PSI program are exceptionnal physicists from __ different contries. Learning about their individual experiences and challenges made me more aware of the internationnal state of the physics community. While the program showed how welcoming and collaborative a physics community can be, it also made me want my privileged reality to be shared by every physics institution. In particular, I want to contribute and benefit from an environnement that has good mental health ressources, conferences about EDI issues and a diverse pool of students that can push my understanding of these issues even further.

Hi Prof. Senthil,

My name is Pierre-Antoine Graham, I am a Perimeter Institute master student interested to contribute to your research for my PhD.

My background is very diverse including quantum many-body physics of cuprates, Weyl semimetals and chaos in quantum computing. This winter, I will be working with Prof. He on a project about the fuzzy sphere method to study conformal symmetry. 

The conclusion of my scattered exploration is that I want to specialize to the intersection of quantum matter and quantum information. One of my prefered topics of research is criticality and non-fermi liquids as a result of my work on cuprates and I feel could produce interesting ideas under your supervision. 

I have attached my CV and would be happy to discuss the current state of your research in a zoom meeting.

# Interview 

I like entanglement because it has a very strong explicative power: it makes statistical ensemble for a system in a bath more intuitive. It is a quantum game theory ressource to share correlations but no information. (There will be group practice)
