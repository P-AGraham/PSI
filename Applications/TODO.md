# SOP Ideas

I am very determinated as a researcher and I really like the thrill of facing the unknown and put every method I learned to work. I like a challenge and I am very perseverent. I want to produce ideas I will be proud of. I always challenge myself to produce better ideas and go further than the lectures ... asking what is next? I like building analogies between concepts I know to strengthen intuition and make every peice of knowledge I have more meaningful. I like thinking about algorithms and feel great satisfaction in the spped up they can provide. I am precise and give importance to consistency of all details. 


Last winter I worked with Professor Alexander Blais's group on a quantum Chaos based single qubit gate. The core of my work was about understanding mixed regular/chaotic dynamics of the classical limit of a superconducting cat qubit subjected to time dependant forcing. The final goal was to establish a relation between rate of tunneling of cat states and the caracteristics of classical chaos.  


Keeping an eye on all the interesting fields I have explored, I am starting to specialize to intersections of condensed matter and quantum information. The decisive element that brought me closer to these disciplines is the connection to technological progress and experiments.

Use the winter project and Essay project to convince I will be doing condensed matter. 

I am currently studying as a Perimeter scholars internationnal (PSI program) master student. For completion of my degree, I will work on an essay about the fuzzy sphere method for 3D CFTs under the supervision of its **inventor?** Yin-Chen He. I will also take part in an intensive winter shcool where to work on **an adaptation of the belief propagation algorithm to Tensor networks (maybe)**.  

MIT is a stepping stone for my career

The Interaction between quantum matter and quantum computing has sparked countless ideas, shaping a second quantum revolution. From high-temperature superconductors to superconducting qubits, these ideas reached me as my journey through academia started and they showed me how modern technology can build on the full elegant machinery of theoretical physics. I aim to become a leader participating in the second quantum revolution with no compromise between concrete application and theoretical sophistication. At the age of 14, I won a writing contest about career ambitions by describing a future where I would play an important role in the development of physics. This dream stayed with me and at the dawn of specialization, working at MIT would help make it a reality. 

My first contact with science took the form of four participations at the Hydro-Québec science fair, followed by a summer job at an astronomical observatory. These opportunities to share my growing passion with the general public made me value scientific communication deeply. This was reflected through my three participations and organization of outreach events at Universite de Sherbrooke as a member of the diversity committee. I also joined tutoring programs where I helped students individually and in groups throughout undergrad. Lately, I have been contributing to the organization of a seminar series for students of my program to share their interests. I plan to carry my desire for excellence in scientific communication to the impressive outreach programs at MIT notably to the Educational Studies Program. 

While outreach projects fostered my interest in the foundations of modern physics, internships helped me explore and refine my aspirations. Eager to go beyond courses and start contributing to science directly, I took an internship during the first summer of my undergraduate. I joined Prof. Jeffrey Quilliam's group to conceive an interface treating nuclear magnetic resonance data generated by experiments on frustrated Kagome crystals at high pressure. Throughout the summer, I developed a rigorous work ethic as I implemented Fourier analysis of spin echos, curve fitting tools, and efficient data storage. Along the way, interactions with experimentalists tainted my theorist view of physics with an appreciation of the work behind data.

With the reality of experimentalists in mind, my theoretical physics journey started in Prof. André-Marie Tremblay's group. My role was to produce and analyze data from two-particle self-consistent approach simulations of electron-doped cuprates. At the beginning of the project, I demonstrated efficient self-learning by rapidly gaining a working understanding of Matsubara frequencies and their role in the evaluation of many-body functions. Meticulously exploring simulation data, I devised a procedure to locate the quantum critical point of the electron-doped phase diagram by approximating temperature for antiferromagnetic pseudogap appearance. My analysis allowed me to qualify the effect of a simple implementation of disorder on the quantum critical point and helped orient further research that would lead to a publication in Physical Review B. Looking back, I see this internship as the origin of my current ambitions in the material sciences. It is the idea that my work could lead to new superconductivity-related technologies that made it so engaging for me. 

The thrill of material sciences became even more vivid with my next internship project. This time, I was working with Prof. Ion Garate on an adaptation of the Van Roosbroeck system of partial differential equations providing a semi-classical description of Weyl semimetals. The goal of the project was to solve the equations to gain insight into the semi-classical role of the chiral anomaly. Having more independence, I produced animations of the numerical evolution of charge densities through time and found a way to decouple the equations using Ampère's law. In the end, we identified the presence of photoinduced plasma oscillations which lead to a publication in Physical Review B. This internship introduced me to the intricacies of non-equilibrium phenomena and the challenging task of bringing a theoretical model closer to an experiment. 

As a second exposition to non-equilibrium phenomena, I collaborated with Prof. Alexandre Blais's group on a small project on the mixed regular/chaotic dynamics of a driven superconducting cat qubit and its classical limit. The fact we were working with the sophisticated ideas of chaos theory to ultimately improve quantum gates was fulfilling and laid the basis of my current career ambitions. Following my objective to play a role in the second revolution, I will participate in a winter research project on a new qubit implementation relying on the stimulated Unruh effect. 

I am currently studying at Perimeter Institute as a Perimeter Scholars International master's student. The coursework portion of the program has shown me excellence in education through its world-class teachers and its exceptional physics students from 17 different countries. My classmate's unique experiences and sets of skills have strengthened my view of physics as an international endeavor. Every day, I grow from cultural exchange and collaborative problem solving where I give my all to embody the values of inclusivity and collaboration of the institute. My peers selected me to receive the Marsland Family PSI award highlighting my contribution to the learning environment of the program and alignment with the values of the institutes. As for the research portion of the program, I will work on a novel way to study emergent conformal symmetry called the "Fuzzy Sphere" method under the supervision of its inventor Prof. Yin-Chen He. MIT feels like the natural next step for me because it provides a continuation of the excellence in education and research I am growing with at Perimeter Institute.  

In light of all my past experiences, I can say I have a strong desire to explore the uses of quantum information methods in many-body physics and non-equilibrium dynamics. I am fascinated by the multidisciplinary aspects of this research direction and its concrete implications for understanding and controlling quantum phenomena at the origin of familiar and mysterious thermodynamical behavior. At MIT, I would be thrilled to join Prof. Soonwon Choi's group because of the diversity of his methods, their proximity to quantum technology, and their alignment with my interests. As a result of my work on chaotic-driven cat qubits, I am particularly curious about his work on ergodicity in time-dependent quantum systems. I am also curious about the criticality aspects of Rydberg quantum simulators. Going in a different direction, I see myself joining Prof. Senthil Todadri's group to expand on my research about non-fermi liquids and quantum criticality in cuprates. A Ph.D. with either of these professors would build on my experience and satisfy my ambitions.

In a general sense, I look forward to making meaningful connections with the great minds of MIT. Collaboration and exchange are central to launching a stimulating career I will be proud of. I would be honored to take part in the cutting-edge research happening at MIT and I am convinced MIT's professors and students will allow me to reach my full potential in this century of great scientific opportunities.

Sincerely,

Pierre-Antoine Graham

When I was 14 years old, my school held a writting competition about passions and career ambitions. In my entry, I told about my fascination for the fundamental nature of things and my theoretical physics aspirations. This fascination would lead me to participate in outreach contests for four consecutive years. Each projects brought me closer to the foundations of theoretical physics. Concrete applications and corroboration of theory became of utmost importance to me As my undergraduate research exploration unfolded. I had the chance to collaborate with four different research groups in the context of four-month internships. Each research project helped me refine my aspirations and build confidence as a scientist. This confidence and experiences brought me to Perimeter Institute where I am gaining independance as a researcher striving to access the cutting edge of theoretical physics. I am appliying to MIT to continue moving in this direction and honnor the passion that led the 14 year old version of me to win the writting contest.  

Is it possible to work at the frontier of theory and experiment and still explore very abstract mathematical ideas? I think we live in a golden age of physics where technology opens up to the craziest ideas and I plan to take advantage of this in my career. Initially driven by outreach contests, I focused on communicating abstract theoretical ideas ranging from special relativity to classical electromagnetism. Then I had the chance to collaborate with four different research groups in the context of four-month internships. Each research project helped me build confidence as a scientist and define my aspirations. While the first three increased my appreciation of experiments and technological prospects, the last one confirmed my interest in abstract ideas. When I picture the career ahead of me, I see a scientist striving to contribute to technology while trying to make unsuspected connections between different areas of physics.

In the light of all my past experience, I can say I am a perseverent and self-driven physicist who will work tirelessly to solve the hardest problems. In particular, these qualities shined last summer when I challenged myself to solve a newly released problem from Project Euler programming challenges. After two weeks of continuous hard work, I became the 69th solver of the problem and started deeply beleiving in my abilities as a creative problem solver. 

As my interest for condensed matter became more established, I started exploring other areas of physics. To satisfy my curiosity towards gravitational physics, I worked with Prof. Valerio Faraoni's group on a map from scalar-tensor gravity to a dissipative fluid with an associated temperature and contributed two two publications. This final undergrad research experience brought me to a bigger research group where I gained confidence as a collaborating scientist.

...In the first half of the internship, I used perturbation theory to explain why a family of cosmological solutions have ill-defined temperatures leading to a Physical Review D paper. In the second half, I proposed an extension of the formalism to multi-scalar tensor gravity, by introducing the idea of an effective multi-fluid described in a publication in The European Physical Journal Plus.

# EDI ideas 

My classmates from the PSI program are exceptionnal physicists from __ different contries. Learning about their individual experiences and challenges made me more aware of the internationnal state of the physics community. While the program showed how welcoming and collaborative a physics community can be, it also made me want my privileged reality to be shared by every physics institution. In particular, I want to contribute and benefit from an environnement that has good mental health ressources, conferences about EDI issues and a diverse pool of students that can push my understanding of these issues even further.

# Interview 

I like entanglement because it has a very strong explicative power: it makes statistical ensemble for a system in a bath more intuitive. It is a quantum game theory ressource to share correlations but no information. (There will be group practice)



# Perimeter Institute PhD

Hi Yin-Chen,

Hope you had a great winter break. I have been working on the code reproducing the results of table XI of arXiv:2210.13482. I attached my current results consisting in a calculation of energy, Casimir operator and Z2 eigenvalues which agree with the benchmark values provided by Zheng. My Z2 eigenvalues are still fractional numbers close to +1 or -1 and I was wondering if this was normal. I have accumulated small questions and curiosities including:

Above eq. 8 of arXiv:2210.13482 it says that the kinetic energy of the LLL is quenched. After exploring the uses of the term "quenched" in the quantum Hall effect literature, I did not find a satisfying explanation of this effect. 
Is there frustration on the Fuzzy sphere ?  Trying to naively visualize the h = 0 (and V0 = 0) ground state of the model, I noticed that placing a Bloch sphere at each point on the sphere and associating the Z axis of the Bloch sphere with the radial direction on the fuzzy sphere (and with the direction of the magnetic field h) possibly leads to frustration of the spins if they lie on the X and Y axis of the Bloch sphere. Does the fuzzification of the sphere remove the frustration? 
It is not possible to put a lattice on a sphere in general, but what about platonic solids? Since the finite-size effects are small, would the results for the triangular Ising model on an icosahedron be accurate? I am aware that this is a different model, and that there might not be a CFT associated to it.
 
and implementation challenges I have encountered in my code. When are you available for a meeting to discuss these questions and the direction of my project? 

I was also wondering if you had openings for a PhD starting next fall. I am interested to work with your group on the fuzzy sphere for my PhD. 

Thank you for your time and happy new year!
Pierre-Antoine


Why Fuzzy sphere method 

Opening paragraph

Quantum matter holds bridges to all fields of physics so by choosing to specialize in it I keep the freedom to explore so much of practically relevant options
Phase transitions: fascinating, emergence, ubiquitous
Multidisciplinary: topology, statistical mechanics, criticality, universality, Ising model, simplicity and rich structure, emergence

Add a link between all my research experience and the projects I target
Photonics and quantum information courses

After an insightful exploration combining research internships and courses from undergraduate to the PSI program, I have decided to specialize in quantum matter and quantum information. At first, my need for interdisciplinary methods reaching all corners of modern physics seemed irreconciliable with any choice, but I realized the phenomena of strongly correlated systems lead back to diverse tools from quantum field theory to general relativiy. I am now determined to advance our understanding and control of quantum materials while making no compromise between theoretical sophistication and practical application. This brings me to apply to Perimeter institute's PhD residency award because it provides an environnement where I have strived as a theoretical physicist and person like never before with researchers that will lead me to the cutting edge theoretical research I want to be part of. Specifically, I want to join Prof. Yin-Chen He's group to produce new results about emergent conformal symmetry with the fuzzy sphere method. I am also interested in working with Prof. Timothy Hsieh to work on the rich structure emerging from entanglement at the intersection of quantum matter and quantum information. 

My theoretical research journey started in Prof. André-Marie Tremblay's group. My role was to produce and analyze data from two-particle self-consistent approach simulations of electron-doped cuprates. At the beginning of the project, I demonstrated efficient self-learning by rapidly gaining a working understanding of Matsubara frequencies and their role in the evaluation of many-body functions. Meticulously exploring simulation data, I devised a procedure to locate the quantum critical point of the electron-doped phase diagram by approximating temperature for antiferromagnetic pseudogap appearance. My analysis allowed me to qualify the effect of a simple implementation of disorder on the quantum critical point. These results lead to a publication in Physical Review B. Looking back, I see this internship as the origin of my current ambitions in quantum matter. It is the idea that my work could lead to new superconductivity-related technologies that made it so engaging for me. This project also introduced me to the mysteries of phase transitions. The statistical physics course from the PSI program then strenghtened my grasp and curiosity for this subject by connecting it to renormalization, conformal field theory and universality. For my PSI essay, I will study emergent conformal symmetry of second order phase transitions trough the fuzzy sphere lens with prof. Yin-Chen He. I would be thrilled to continue unfolding the potential I see in this method troughout my PhD. It is tied to topology, relativity and quantum field theory while targetting deep questions on phase transitions which is exactly the multidisciplinary research I was looking for. 

My determination to understand and control exotic quantum materials became even more vivid with my second theoretical research internship. I worked with Prof. Ion Garate on an adaptation of the Van Roosbroeck system of partial differential equations to describe Weyl semimetals interacting with light. The goal of the project was to solve the equations to gain insight into the semi-classical role of the chiral anomaly. I found a way to decouple the equations further using an adaptation of Ampère's law and animated the evolution of charge densities through time. In the end, we identified the presence of photoinduced plasma oscillations, leading to a publication in Physical Review B. This internship brought me to the mysterious properties of topological materials which I pushed forther with a small review of the litterature on topological insulators. Computationnal aspects of theoretical research align directly with my passion for recreationnal programming challenges.

 I learned how to use the Cedar supercomputer to produce and analyse data for my research project in Prof. André-Marie Tremblay's group
teached me how to implement various algorithms for simulating physical systems. It is clear that . A PhD in prof Yin-Chen He's group provides exciting scientific programming challenges which I can't wait to tackle with creativity and elegance. Having performed cuprate simulations on the Cedar supercomputer, I am exicted to take my computer science skills further and make the most out of the computationnal resources of Perimeter Institute.
