# Issues

1. Rest induced transparency involves smaller $I_+$ compared to AIT (AIT has chirp enhancing $I_+$ on the postive $k$ axis)
2. As we increase $T$, we get sharper minima in $I_-$ (Less transparent to bandwith in cavity modes)
3. Potential solution: Measure at Regular intervals: This is btter the usual quantum Zeno (the time interval on which transparency works is longer than the small quantum Zeno interval) AITZE
4. Impossible (In more than 1D) to make a cavity with modes fully aligned with the zeros of $I_-$
5. Depends on time (The zeros become more numerous but sharper)
6. The field moving the detector will varry a lot ($E q/m = a \implies \dot{E} \propto \dot{a}$ And creates a mess of photons in all modes of the cavity) We have an optimisation problem to solve (there is a range of acceptable accelerations that does not produce enough photons to trigger the $I_+$ gates)
7. Conservation of energy means that if we do a $g \to e$ gate we have put exactly one quantum of energy in our system (we neglect back reaction) 
8. The hyperbolic patched trajectory is very similar to the inertial trajectory because the shape of $I_-$ going to $0$ is the same (but it has chrip making $I_+$ bigger)
9. Measurements destroy entanglement and coherence (restores to the prepared state)
10. Make $I_+ = -I_-$
11. Use switching to make the time interval finite in spirit and thus remove the time dependance of transparency of the modes (the idea is switch the coupling on when you want to apply a gate, but this does not allow a constant protection from stray fields)
