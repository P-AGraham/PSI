Extended Wigner"s friend, 
inequalities are nonclassical causal compatibility inequalities
P(IS|H) = P(I|H) * P(S|H) (I and S have a common cause)
External cause A affecting only one outcome 

bell no go theorem 
Alice and Bob share a system, A and B chose a variable used to determined their local action on the system. A and B are spacelike separated. Choose measurement settings outside of the light cone of the other player 

P(A|XY) = P(A|X)
P(B|XY) = P(B|Y)
(no faster than light)
+ Bell inequality

Other structure never explain no signaling between A and B 
Would have to be fine tuned. Change the way causality works
(same structure, but GPT causal modeling) still fails at satisfying bells theorem. Bob shares with Charlie, (Alice, superobserver). She measures Charlies system. Everyone is space like separated. LF dag. If X = 0, Alice copies charlie s outcome

P(A|XY) = P(A|X)
P(B|XY) = P(B|Y)
(no faster than light)
+ LF inequalities (violated). Charlie is entangled with his system and is in a full quantum superposition
Alice can erase Charlie s memory steal his system and measure herself.  

Use any kind of quantum memory. Local friendliness

can change structure to fined tuned structures associated to superluminal causation, superdeterminism and retrocausality. 

Quantum GPT causal model is not suited to explain violation of the LF inequalities

Entanglement and black holes (ads/dft ---> understanding black hole evaporation with entanglement) Problems with current approaches. Direct quantification of space time lead to divergences ... measures of entanglement depend on the amount of degrees of freedom so diverges usual approaches. Opperationnal approaches Couple probe system to space time (meaningful way to talk about particle content ... particle are defined asdetectors counts.... detector never yields infinity as a result local measurement). Transfert entanglement from a field to a local detector. Area la recovered form multiple detectors. (Leraning about QG, detector models, Ads/CFT)

No experimental guidance to quantum gravity (scattered quantum gravity community .... what happens before scientific revolution). Classical gravity includes thermodynamics. First law. Spacetime must have macroscopic degrees of freedom. We can dervive einstein"s equations by assuming thermodynamics properties. What are the quantum gravitationnal degrees of freedom. Symmetry unitary representation gives strong constraincts on the QFT states. Gives classification of particles --- they all have mass and spin ... does gravity have symmetries (Corner symmetries) We can do any coordinate transformation --- is there physical content in this symmetry or is it redundant. gives a notion of a gravitationnal charge (Corner charge) trying to quantize the group of symmetry. whatever the theory of QG is it respects these symmetries if they are not redundant.

What if there is no antimater and matter symmetry. Charge conjugation takes you from matter to antimatter ... before weak interaction ... with weak interaction (Need CP... maybe more) the universe is neutral. LHC produces equal ammount of matter and anti matter. Different lifetime and decay products of neutron systems. (Would violate CPT, quantum gravity does that). We have no experimental bound on lifetime of anti neutrons---> use an analogy between neutrons and kaons (still a hadron). There a re long lived kaons and short lived kaons. A universe con start entirely from neutrons. Does antimater behave differently in gravity explain dark matter
